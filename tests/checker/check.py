# This script will check how many regular expression/target target pairs have
# produced the correct result, and report statistics on them.
# It can be used in three ways:
# - You can provide two filenames as arguments, the first containing the output
#   of your program, and the second the expected results for that set of
#   patterns as provided, and it will report how many were correct overall,
#   as well as how many matches/non-matches/syntax errors were computed
#   accurately.
#
#   It will write a list of any non-matching lines into mismatches.txt,
#   including line numbers and both the expected and actual result.
# - If you put your program's output into a file called e.g. parens-output.txt
#   next to the parens-expected.txt file, you can provide a single argument
#   "parens" to compare those two files, and produce the same report as above.
# - If you have many files parens-outputs.txt, wild-outputs.txt, etc, next to
#   the *-expected.txt files, you can provide a single argument --all, and it
#   will report just the percentage of each group that was correctly matched.
#   You can also provide a second argument that is the path to the directory
#   containing all of those files. This will not produce a list of mismatches,
#   or break down the matching/non-matching/error lines, just show the
#   percentage correct from each group.
#
# Run it as e.g.
#     python3 checker/check.py output.txt expected.txt
# Save your output into a file with e.g.
#     ruby expression1.rb expressions.txt targets.txt > output.txt
